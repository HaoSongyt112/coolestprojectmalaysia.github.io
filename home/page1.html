        <h2 class="desc" style="text-align: center;">Healthy oceans and seas are essential to our existence.They cover 70% of our planet and we rely on them for the resources. Yet, we have managed to do tremendous damage to these <p id="detail">precious resources</p>. We must protect them by eliminating pollution and overfishing and immediately start to responsibly manage and protect all marine life around the world.</h2>

                <h3>THE OCEANS, SEAS AND MARINE RESOURCES</h3>
                <ul class="desc1">
                    <li>Food Source: Oceans are a major source of food for billions of people. Fish and seafood provide essential nutrients and proteins, and marine ecosystems contribute to the global food chain.</li>
                    <li>Climate Regulation: Oceans help regulate the Earth's climate by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide (CO2). They also influence weather patterns and help distribute heat around the planet.</li>
                    <li>Oxygen Production: Phytoplankton, tiny marine plants, produce a significant portion of the Earth's oxygen through photosynthesis, making the oceans essential for the air we breathe.</li>
                    <li>Water Cycle: Oceans are integral to the global water cycle. They help generate moisture for precipitation and influence the distribution of freshwater through evaporation and condensation.</li>
                    <li>Energy Resources: Oceans offer potential for renewable energy sources, such as tidal and wave energy. They also contain reserves of oil and natural gas, though these resources need to be managed carefully to minimize environmental impact.</li>
                    <li>Biodiversity: Marine environments are home to an incredible diversity of species, from the smallest plankton to the largest whales. This biodiversity is essential for ecosystem health and resilience.</li>
                    <li>Economic Value: Beyond food and energy, oceans contribute to economies through tourism, shipping, and recreation. Healthy marine environments support vibrant coastal communities and industries.</li>
